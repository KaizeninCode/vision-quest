                VQ&apos;s Governance Sector strengthens accountability and
                improves government performance by providing technical advice,
                strategic guidance, and support to public institutions, elected
                bodies, and citizens. Based on a thorough understanding of the
                incentives, interests, and political economy inherent to policy
                development and implementation, we have continued to supply
                tailored solutions to policy makers, citizen leaders, and
                elected representatives. <br />
                <br />
                Our approach to governance has also helped identify and foster
                engagement between citizens and their government, recognizing
                that both the supply and demand for good governance is necessary
                to initiate change. In doing so, we have also empowered leaders,
                recognizing that locally led solutions have the greatest
                potential for sustainability. Through our partnerships, we have
                harnessed convening power to actively bring together
                governments, key humanitarian and development actors to support
                open dialogue around complexities faced in fragile and
                conflict-affected countries.

                A decade plus of transformative work (research, analysis and
                project implementation in resource poor settings in Africa) has
                demonstrated to us that exclusion and gender inequality
                consistently go hand in hand. And that societies that lag
                furthest behind are those where laws and traditions hinder
                gender equality and women&apos;s empowerment. Our theory of
                change is based on our experience that achieving gender equality
                and women&apos;s empowerement require transformative change.
